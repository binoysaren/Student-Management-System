### Network or Signup Error

1. Go to `frontend/.env` and uncomment the first line.
2. Restart frontend:

const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```

3. Replace `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` with `REACT_APP_BASE_URL`
4. Repeat the process for all files ending with `Handle.js` in redux folders.
